# Reusable D3 Edge Examples

Creating reusable (v5) charts from the examples in "Developing a D3.js Edge" (https://bleedingedgepress.com/developing-a-d3-js-edge/) by Chris Viau, Andrew Thornton, Ger Hobbelt, and Roland Dunn.

Original charts GitHub repository: https://github.com/backstopmedia/D3Edge

Charts are created using a pattern based on that from Pro D3.js (https://link.springer.com/book/10.1007/978-1-4842-5203-1) by Marcos Iglesias. The charts use v5, vanilla js and are created in a single file to aid noobs. I may add additional d3 versions later and create in modules.
