# Reusable Interactive Data Viz Examples

Creating reusable (v5) charts from the examples in "Interactive Data Visualization for the Web, 2nd Edition" (https://www.oreilly.com/library/view/interactive-data-visualization/9781491921296/) by Scott Murray (https://alignedleft.com/work/d3-book).

Original charts GitHub repository: https://github.com/scotthmurray/d3-book

Illustration of chart examples hosted on web(v3 and not all in reusable format): https://hanmomhanda.github.io/mastering-d3-html/

Charts are created using a pattern based on that from Pro D3.js (https://link.springer.com/book/10.1007/978-1-4842-5203-1) by Marcos Iglesias. The charts use v5, vanilla js and are created in a single file to aid noobs. I may add additional d3 versions later and create in modules.
