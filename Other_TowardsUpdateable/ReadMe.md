# Reusable Towards Updateable d3.js charts (blog) Examples

Creating reusable (v5) charts from the examples in Rob Moores blog "Towards Updatable D3.js Charts" https://www.toptal.com/d3-js/towards-reusable-d3-js-charts

Original charts: 
- GitHub repository: https://gist.github.com/robert-moore/9f2908455355c0589619

Charts are created using a pattern based on that from Pro D3.js (https://link.springer.com/book/10.1007/978-1-4842-5203-1) by Marcos Iglesias. The charts use v5, vanilla js and are created in a single file to aid noobs. I may add additional d3 versions later and create in modules.

The charts have had to adopt the new updated pattern as they are d3v5 (which took me sometime to work out), thus they have both the .merge() and .join() configurations see the GUP for more info/ insight.

List of example charts:

- **.merge()** example.

- **.join()** example.
