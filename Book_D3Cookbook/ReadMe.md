# Reusable D3 Cookbook Examples

Creating reusable (v5) charts from the examples in "Data Visulization with D3.js Cookbook" (https://www.packtpub.com/product/data-visualization-with-d3-js-cookbook/9781782162162) by Nick Qu Zhu 

Charts are created using a pattern based on that from Pro D3.js (https://link.springer.com/book/10.1007/978-1-4842-5203-1) by Marcos Iglesias.
They use v5, vanilla js and are created in a single file to aid noobs. I may add additional d3 versions later and create in modules.
