# Reusable General Update Pattern (GUP) - notebooks - Alphabet Examples

Creating reusable (v5) charts from the alphabet examples in Mike Bostock's blog (observable notebook/ bl.ock) "General Update Pattern (GUP)" (https://observablehq.com/@d3/general-update-pattern) and "*selections*.join" (https://observablehq.com/@d3/selection-join).
In addition I include John GÃ³mez's "General Update Pattern Explained" as this provides further understanding of how the GUP works.

Original chart bl.ocks (observable notebook links above): 
- **General Update Pattern III** https://bl.ocks.org/mbostock/3808234
- **General Update Pattern Explained** https://bl.ocks.org/john-guerra/cabfbaed34d942e4dd81199855e4987f

Charts are created using a pattern based on that from Pro D3.js (https://link.springer.com/book/10.1007/978-1-4842-5203-1) by Marcos Iglesias. The charts use v5, vanilla js and are created in a single file to aid noobs. I may add additional d3 versions later and create in modules.

The charts have had to adopt the new updated pattern as they are d3v5 (which took me sometime to work out), thus these examples provide both the .merge() and .join() configurations to aid (my) understanding.

List of *reusable* example charts:

- **General Update Pattern III** uses *.merge()*
- **General Update Pattern III** uses *.join()*
- **General Update Pattern Explained (original)** uses *.merge()*
- **General Update Pattern Explained (updated)** uses *.join()*
