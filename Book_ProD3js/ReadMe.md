# Reusable Pro D3.js Examples

Creating reusable (v5) charts from the examples in "Pro D3.js" (https://link.springer.com/book/10.1007/978-1-4842-5203-1) by Marcos Iglesias.

This provides the basis for the rest fo the charts in this repository. The main deviation is that the charts here use v5, vanilla js and are created in a single file to aid noobs. I may add additional d3 versions later and create in modules.

List of example charts (by chapter):

- Chapter 5: Making the Bar Chart Production-Ready
  - bar chart
  - bar chart with transitions
