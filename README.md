# D3_Reusable
A collection of projects to develop charts using the reusable pattern.

Learning to develop the pattern by translating existing d3v3 into d3v5 (most books written in v3). Pattern largely taken from ProD3

Projects:

- D3v5 Tips and Tricks
- D3 CookBook
- Mastering D3
- D3 Edge

Goal to have my own set of reusable charts
