# D3_Reusable
A collection of projects to develop charts using the reusable pattern. The pattern largely taken from ProD3 (https://link.springer.com/book/10.1007/978-1-4842-5203-1).

Learning to develop the pattern by translating existing d3v3 into d3v5 (most books are written in v3). 
They are generally written in vanilla js with one file. Although I recognise this is not best practice, I found it easier to understand when I was new and learning d3, so thought keeping this may aid others. I intend to update the charts in modules as well, if I get around to it.

Project list:

Book examples

- D3v5 Tips and Tricks
- D3 CookBook
- Mastering D3
- D3 Edge
- Interactive Data Visualization

Other examples - that helped me solve issues along the way:

- General Update Pattern - alphabet examples of selection.merge(https://observablehq.com/@d3/general-update-pattern) and selection.join(https://observablehq.com/@d3/selection-join) : Mike Bostock https://bl.ocks.org/mbostock/3808234
(in addition I include "General Update Pattern Explained" (https://bl.ocks.org/john-guerra/cabfbaed34d942e4dd81199855e4987f) by John Alexis Guerra GÃ³mez
- Towards Updatable D3.js Charts : Rob Moore
- Nesting and Accessing Data in D3v4 : Amber Thomas https://amber.rbind.io/2017/05/02/nesting

My goal is to have my own set of reusable charts
