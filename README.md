# D3_Reusable
A collection of projects to develop charts using the reusable pattern. The pattern largely taken from [ProD3.js](https://link.springer.com/book/10.1007/978-1-4842-5203-1).

Learning to develop the pattern by translating existing d3v3 into d3v5 (most books are written in v3). 
They are generally written in vanilla js with one file. The charts are not written mainly in ES2015, there are some ES2015 elements. Although I recognise this is not best practice, I found it easier to understand when I was new and learning d3, so thought keeping this may aid others. I intend to update the charts in modules and make ES2015 as well, if I get around to it.
