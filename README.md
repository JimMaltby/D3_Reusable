# D3_Reusable
A collection of projects to develop charts using the reusable pattern.

Learning to develop the pattern by translating existing d3v3 into d3v5 (most books written in v3). Pattern largely taken from ProD3
They are generally written in vanilla js with one file. Although I recognise this is not best practice I found it easier to understand when I was new and learning, do thought keeping this may aid others. I intend to modulate the charts as well, if I get around to it.

Project list:

Book examples

- D3v5 Tips and Tricks
- D3 CookBook
- Mastering D3
- D3 Edge
- Interactive Data Visualization

Other examples - that helped me solve issues along the way:

- General Update pattern - alphabet example: Mike Bostock
- Nesting and Accessing Data in D3v4 : Amber Thomas https://amber.rbind.io/2017/05/02/nesting/
- Towards Updatable D3.js Charts : Rob Moore

My goal is to have my own set of reusable charts
